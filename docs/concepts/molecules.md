# Molecules

Molecules are workflow templates that coordinate multi-step work in Gas Town.

## Molecule Lifecycle

```
Formula (source TOML) ─── "Ice-9"
    │
    ▼ bd cook
Protomolecule (frozen template) ─── Solid
    │
    ├─▶ bd mol pour ──▶ Mol (persistent) ─── Liquid
    │
    └─▶ bd mol wisp --root-only ──▶ Root Wisp (ephemeral) ─── Vapor
```

**Root-only wisps**: Formula steps are NOT materialized as database rows. Only a
single root wisp is created. Agents read steps inline from the embedded formula
at prime time. This prevents wisp accumulation (~6,000+ rows/day → ~400/day).

## Core Concepts

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Formula** | Source TOML template defining workflow steps |
| **Protomolecule** | Frozen template ready for instantiation |
| **Molecule** | Active workflow instance (root wisp only) |
| **Wisp** | Ephemeral molecule for patrols and polecat work (never synced) |
| **Root-only** | Only root wisp created; steps read from embedded formula |

## How Agents See Steps

Agents do NOT use `bd mol current` or `bd close <step-id>` for formula workflows.
Instead, formula steps are rendered inline when the agent runs `gt prime`:

```
**Formula Checklist** (10 steps from mol-polecat-work):

### Step 1: Load context and verify assignment
Initialize your session and understand your assignment...

### Step 2: Set up working branch
Ensure you're on a clean feature branch...
```

The agent works through the checklist and runs `gt done` (polecats) or
`gt patrol report` (patrol agents) when complete.

## Molecule Commands

### Beads Operations (bd)

```bash
# Formulas
bd formula list              # Available formulas
bd formula show <name>       # Formula details
bd cook <formula>            # Formula → Proto

# Molecules (data operations)
bd mol list                  # Available protos
bd mol show <id>             # Proto details
bd mol wisp <proto>          # Create wisp (root-only by default)
bd mol bond <proto> <parent> # Attach to existing mol
```

### Agent Operations (gt)

```bash
# Hook management
gt hook                    # What's on MY hook?
gt prime                   # Shows inline formula checklist
gt mol attach <bead> <mol>   # Pin molecule to bead
gt mol detach <bead>         # Unpin molecule from bead

# Patrol lifecycle
gt patrol new              # Create patrol wisp and hook it
gt patrol report --summary "..."  # Close current patrol, start next cycle
```

## Polecat Workflow

Polecats receive work via their hook — a root wisp attached to an issue.
They see the formula checklist inline when they run `gt prime` and work
through each step in order.

### Polecat Workflow Summary

```
1. Spawn with work on hook
2. gt prime               # Shows formula checklist inline
3. Work through each step
4. Persist findings: bd update <issue> --notes "..."
5. gt done                # Submit, nuke sandbox, exit
```

### Molecule Types

| Type | Storage | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Root-only Wisp** | `.beads/` (ephemeral) | Polecat work, patrols |

All formula-based work uses root-only wisps. Steps are read from the
embedded binary, not materialized as database rows.

## Patrol Workflow

Patrol agents (Deacon, Witness, Refinery) cycle through patrol formulas:

```
1. gt patrol new          # Create root-only patrol wisp
2. gt prime               # Shows patrol checklist inline
3. Work through each step
4. gt patrol report --summary "..."  # Close + start next cycle
```

`gt patrol report` atomically closes the current patrol root and spawns
a new one for the next cycle.

## Best Practices

1. **Persist findings early** — `bd update <issue> --notes "..."` before session death
2. **Run `gt done` when complete** — mandatory for polecats (pushes, submits to MQ, nukes)
3. **Use `gt patrol report`** — for patrol agents to cycle (replaces squash+new pattern)
4. **File discovered work** — `bd create` for bugs found, don't fix them yourself
