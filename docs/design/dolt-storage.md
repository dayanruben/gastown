# Dolt Storage Architecture

> **Status**: Current reference for Gas Town agents
> **Updated**: 2026-02-16
> **Context**: Dolt is the sole storage backend for Beads and Gas Town

---

## Overview

Gas Town uses [Dolt](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt), an open-source
SQL database with Git-like versioning (Apache 2.0). One Dolt SQL server
per town serves all databases via MySQL protocol on port 3307. There is
no embedded mode, no SQLite, and no JSONL.

The `gt daemon` manages the server lifecycle (auto-start, health checks
every 30s, crash restart with exponential backoff).

## Server Architecture

```
Dolt SQL Server (one per town, port 3307)
├── hq/       town-level beads  (hq-* prefix)
├── gastown/  rig beads         (gt-* prefix)
├── beads/    rig beads         (bd-* prefix)
└── ...       additional rigs
```

**Data directory**: `~/.dolt-data/` — each subdirectory is a database
accessible via `USE <name>` in SQL.

**Connection**: `root@tcp(127.0.0.1:3307)/<database>` (no password for
localhost).

## Commands

```bash
# Daemon manages server lifecycle (preferred)
gt daemon start

# Manual management
gt dolt start          # Start server
gt dolt stop           # Stop server
gt dolt status         # Health check, list databases
gt dolt logs           # View server logs
gt dolt sql            # Open SQL shell
gt dolt init-rig <X>   # Create a new rig database
gt dolt list           # List all databases
```

If the server isn't running, `bd` fails fast with a clear message
pointing to `gt dolt start`.

## Write Concurrency: All-on-Main

All agents — polecats, crew, witness, refinery, deacon — write directly
to `main`. Concurrency is managed through transaction discipline: every
write wraps `BEGIN` / `DOLT_COMMIT` / `COMMIT` atomically.

```
bd update <bead> --status=in_progress
  → BEGIN
  → UPDATE issues SET status='in_progress' ...
  → CALL DOLT_COMMIT('-Am', 'update status')
  → COMMIT
```

This eliminates the former branch-per-worker strategy (BD_BRANCH,
per-polecat Dolt branches, merge-at-done). All writes are immediately
visible to all agents — no cross-agent visibility gaps.

Multi-statement `bd` commands batch their writes inside a single
transaction to maintain atomicity.

## Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE issues (
    id VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY,
    type VARCHAR(32),
    title TEXT,
    description TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(32),
    priority INT,
    owner VARCHAR(255),
    assignee VARCHAR(255),
    labels JSON,
    parent VARCHAR(64),
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    closed_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE mail (
    id VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY,
    thread_id VARCHAR(64),
    from_addr VARCHAR(255),
    to_addrs JSON,
    subject TEXT,
    body TEXT,
    sent_at TIMESTAMP,
    read_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE channels (
    id VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    type VARCHAR(32),
    config JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Dolt-Specific Capabilities

These are available to agents via SQL and used throughout Gas Town:

| Feature | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| `dolt_history_*` tables | Full row-level history, queryable via SQL |
| `AS OF` queries | Time-travel: "what did this look like yesterday?" |
| `dolt_diff()` | "What changed between these two points?" |
| `DOLT_COMMIT` | Explicit commit with message (auto-commit is the default) |
| `DOLT_MERGE` | Merge branches (integration branches, federation) |
| `dolt_conflicts` table | Programmatic conflict resolution after merge |
| `DOLT_BRANCH` | Create/delete branches (integration branches) |

**Auto-commit** is on by default: every write gets a Dolt commit. Agents
can batch writes by disabling auto-commit temporarily.

**Conflict resolution** default: `newest` (most recent `updated_at` wins).
Arrays (labels): `union` merge. Counters: `max`.

## Three Data Planes

Beads data falls into three planes with different characteristics:

| Plane | What | Mutation | Durability | Transport |
|-------|------|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Operational** | Work in progress, status, assignments, heartbeats | High (seconds) | Days–weeks | Dolt SQL server (local) |
| **Ledger** | Completed work, permanent record, skill vectors | Low (completion boundaries) | Permanent | DoltHub remotes + federation |
| **Design** | Epics, RFCs, specs — ideas not yet claimed | Conversational | Until crystallized | DoltHub commons (shared) |

The operational plane lives entirely in the local Dolt server. The ledger
and design planes federate via DoltHub using the Highway Operations
Protocol — Gas Town's public federation layer built on Dolt's native
push/pull remotes.

## Ephemeral Data Lifecycle (CRITICAL)

Dolt is sensitive to row volume and versioning overhead. Every row change
creates a new chunk in Dolt's content-addressed storage. Without active
garbage collection, databases bloat rapidly.

### Two Data Streams

```
EPHEMERAL (wisps, patrol data)          SACRED (issues, molecules, mail, agents)
  CREATE                                  CREATE
  → work                                  → work
  → CLOSE (>24h)                          → CLOSE
  → SQUASH to digest summary              → JSONL export (scrubbed)
  → DELETE original rows                  → git push to GitHub
  → digest into git                       → never delete from Dolt
```

**Ephemeral data** (wisps, wisp_events, wisp_labels, wisp_deps) is
high-volume patrol exhaust. It's valuable in real-time but worthless
after 24 hours. The Reaper Dog squashes it into digest summaries
(aggregate stats per cycle), then DELETES the original rows. Without
this, wisp tables grow without bound and Dolt performance degrades.

**Sacred data** (issues, molecules, agents, mail, dependencies, labels)
is the permanent ledger. It's backed up via JSONL exports (scrubbed of
test artifacts and pollution) and pushed to GitHub. Never deleted from
Dolt unless corrupted.

### Dolt GC (Non-Negotiable)

`dolt gc` compacts old chunk data. Without it, databases bloat by 10-50x.
The Doctor Dog runs gc at least daily. This is the single most important
maintenance operation.

```bash
# Manual gc (stop server first for exclusive access)
gt dolt stop
cd ~/.dolt-data/<db> && dolt gc
gt dolt start

# Or: Doctor Dog runs it automatically via daemon
```

### Pollution Prevention

Pollution enters Dolt via:
1. **Test artifacts**: test code creates issues on production server
2. **Wisp accumulation**: wisps closed but never deleted
3. **Orphan databases**: test DBs that survive cleanup
4. **Zombie servers**: test dolt-server processes in /tmp

Prevention is layered:
- **Firewall** (store.go): refuses test-prefixed CREATE DATABASE on port 3307
- **Reaper Dog**: deletes closed wisps, auto-closes stale issues
- **Doctor Dog**: runs gc, kills zombie servers, detects orphan DBs
- **JSONL Dog**: scrubs exports, rejects pollution, spike-detects before commit
- **Janitor Dog**: cleans test server (port 3308)

## Standalone Beads Note

The `bd` CLI retains an embedded Dolt option for standalone use (outside
Gas Town). Server-only mode applies to Gas Town exclusively — standalone
users may not have a Dolt server running.

## Remote Push (Git Protocol)

Gas Town pushes Dolt databases to GitHub remotes via `gt dolt sync`. These
use git SSH protocol (`git+ssh://git@github.com/...`), not DoltHub's native
protocol.

### Git Remote Cache

Dolt maintains a cache at `.dolt-data/<db>/.dolt/git-remote-cache/` that
stores git objects built from Dolt's internal format. Per the Dolt team
(Dustin Brown, 2026-02-26):

- **The cache is necessary** — Dolt uses it to build git objects for push/pull
- **Accumulates garbage** (orphaned refs) and is not cleaned up automatically
- **Safe to delete** between pushes, but causes a full rebuild on next push
  (beads: ~20 min rebuild, gastown: even longer)
- **Orphaned refs** can be pruned without deleting the whole cache — better balance
- **Grows over time** as the database grows — inherent to git-protocol remotes

**Guidance**: Do NOT routinely delete the cache. Prefer pruning orphaned refs.
Full deletion should only be done when disk pressure is critical and a long
rebuild is acceptable.

### Sync Procedure

`gt dolt sync` parks all rigs (stops witnesses/refineries), stops the Dolt
server, runs `dolt push` for each database with a configured remote, then
restarts the server and unparks rigs. The parking prevents witnesses from
detecting the server outage and restarting it mid-push.

### Force Push

After data recovery (e.g., Clown Show #13), local and remote histories
diverge. Use `gt dolt sync --force` for the first push to overwrite the
remote with local state. Subsequent pushes should work without `--force`.

### Known Limitations

- **Slow**: Git-protocol remotes are orders of magnitude slower than DoltHub
  native remotes. A 71MB database takes ~90s; larger ones take 20+ minutes.
- **Cache growth**: No automatic garbage collection. Orphan pruning TBD.
- **Server downtime**: Push requires exclusive access to the data directory,
  so the server must be stopped during push. This creates a maintenance window.

### Future: DoltHub Remotes

DoltHub's native protocol (`https://doltremoteapi.dolthub.com/...`) avoids
the git-remote-cache entirely and is much faster. Migration requires DoltHub
accounts and reconfiguring remotes with `dolt remote set-url`.
